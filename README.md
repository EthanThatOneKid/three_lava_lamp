## Artwork

I wrote my solution for today's challenge in a Deno file and bundled it for use in the browser.

Bundle the `main.ts` file with the following command:

```sh
deno task bundle
```

Then open the `./static/index.html` file in your browser after spinning up a local file server.

```sh
deno task start
```
